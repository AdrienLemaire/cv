%	LETTER CONTENT
%----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

I am writing this letter to show my keen interest in Lumos Labs. I will be
quitting my current devops position at Alpaca.ai in less than 2 months, and
after playing on Lumosity for near to 2 months, I've come to really appreciate
this application and wish to become part of the team and improve it. Along with my
Master's Degree in Computer Science from SUPINFO and 8 years' experience in the
field of IT, particularly in Development Operations, I am confident in my
ability to become an essential member of Lumos Labs.

From my experience in startups such as
\href{http://www.aquasys.co.jp/}{Aquasys} and
\href{https://www.alpaca.ai/}{Alpaca.ai}, one of my main
responsabilities were to build, maintain and improve their infrastructure,
mostly hosted on AWS. As an example, we've recently released Labell.io, deep
learning labelling and model training platform, and I succesfully built a scalable
system, which could stay up-running despite a high load spike at
launch, Several bugs could be quickly identified and hotfixed without
disturbing the operations.

It would be a great pleasure to meet with you in an interview to discuss my
qualifications and experience in detail. Although I'm living in Osaka and do not
plan to relocate before a couple years, I would be perfectly operational working
remotely with a few trips every year to San Francisco (one of the cities I
enjoyed most living in) to get some quality time with the team.

Thank you for your time and consideration, I look forward to speaking with you
further.
