%	LETTER CONTENT
%----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

I am writing this letter to show my keen interest in IFTTT. I will be
quitting my current position at \href{https://www.alpaca.ai/}{Alpaca.ai}
in less than 2 months, and I'm now looking for work in the areas that
passionate me most: Productivity, Efficiency and Education. IFTTT is doing all
of it by connecting applications in an IoT, and helped me in many cases
(especially Slack integrations). Along with my Master's Degree in Computer
Science from SUPINFO and 8 years' experience in the field of IT, I am confident
in my ability to become an essential member of the IFTTT team.

From my experience in startups such as
\href{http://www.aquasys.co.jp/}{Aquasys} and
\href{https://www.alpaca.ai/}{Alpaca.ai}, I've had opportunities to work at
every steps of a software development process, from System administration to
Front-end development, Management and Mentoring. I have a great disposition for
learning, and am always working on improving my productivity and efficiency to
allow me handling a number of activities I'm passionate about. This is why I
could take on any of the engineering positions, whether it's Data,
Infrastructure, Systems, or API.

It would be a great pleasure to meet with you in an interview to discuss my
qualifications and experience in detail. Although I'm living in Osaka and do not
plan to relocate before a couple years, I would be perfectly operational working
remotely with a few trips every year to San Francisco to get some quality time
with the team.

Thank you for your time and consideration, I look forward to speaking with you
further.
